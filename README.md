# REAL-TIME-STOCK--PRICE-PREDICTION-ANALYSIS

A machine learning-based project that performs real-time stock price prediction using historical financial data and streaming data APIs. 
This project combines data engineering, time-series analysis, and predictive modeling to help visualize and forecast stock movements.

# FEATURES
-Real-time data fetching using financial APIs.
-Data preprocessing and feature engineering.
-Predictive modeling using LSTM/GRU/Prophet.
-Interactive visualizations with live updates.
-Modular codebase for easy expansion.

# TECHNOLOGIES AND TOOLS
=> Languages: Python, JavaScript (for dashboarding).
=> Libraries:
      -Data Processing: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn.
      -Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn, plotly.
      -Machine Learning: tensorflow, keras.
      -Real-time Data: yfinance API.
=> Deployment: Flask or DJango.

# INSTALLATION
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/real-time-stock-price-prediction.git
cd real-time-stock-price-prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt

# USAGE
=> Configure the API key in config.py or .env.
=> Run the Streamlit dashboard:
        -streamlit run app.py
=> Select your stock ticker and timeframe in the UI.

# MODEL OVERVIEW
This project implements and compares multiple models for forecasting:
    -LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory): Suitable for time-series forecasting with sequential dependencies.
    -Prophet: A decomposable additive model developed by Facebook.
    -Linear Regression/Random Forest: As baselines.

# DATA SOURCES
-Yahoo Finance via yfinance.
-Alpha Vantage (for intraday data).
-Optional: Web scraping with BeautifulSoup or Selenium for news sentiment.

# TO-DO
 -Integrate sentiment analysis from news headlines.
 -Add more models (ARIMA, XGBoost).
 -Backtesting module.
 -Dockerize the application.
